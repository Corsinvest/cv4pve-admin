The easiest and most effective solution to monitor your multiple Proxmox VE cluster in a single web portal.

{app-name} boost your Proxmox VE infrastructure.

One of the main design goals was to make use as simple as possible. You can use cv4pve-admin for a single node or cluster of many nodes. All management tasks can be performed using web-based management interface and even a novice user can set up and install {app-name} in minutes.

== Why

The reason that led us to develop cv4pve-admin for Proxmox VE is:

* The lack of functionality we need
* The desire to facilitate the management of infrastructures to the IT Manager

Example:

How do we know if backups have been successful? And their execution times? How much do they occupy?::
  Everything is clearly written in the log.

How do I know if jobs come overlap? How much is the load?::
  The log contains the dates and durations and on which host it is running.

How can I see occupancy of a VM at the storage level?::
  Go to VM - Check storage - Check backups

Would I like to take snapshots every 15 minutes?::
  it is not possible

We have implemented simple solutions to get information immediately and in a simple way.

== Web-Based

{app-name} is simple to use. Management tasks can be performed through the included web-based management interface – there is no need to install a separate management tool.

== Benefits

* Fast installation and easy-to-use
* Web-based management interface
* Low administration costs and simple deployment
* Manage multiple clusters in a single installation

== Project

The project started in 2016, with command line cv4pve-tools. The tools are Open Source on the site https://github.com/Corsinvest?q=cv4pve[GitHub] and are still maintained today. Initially we used shell commands inside {pve-name}. We immediately understood the fragility of the system.

We have developed the https://github.com/Corsinvest?q=cv4pve-api-[API] for various languages (C#, Java, Php, JavaScript, Power Shell and more) and then we have re-implemented all the tools. This gave us the ability to be independent from the internal modifications of {pve-name}, and made it possible to run outside of {pve-name}.

The GUI version started 2019. {app-url-site}
