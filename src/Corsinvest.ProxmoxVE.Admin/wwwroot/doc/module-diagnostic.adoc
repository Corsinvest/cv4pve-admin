= Diagnostic

== Need

Have a diagnostic that detects the errors that are commonly made in infrastructure management.
Example:

* backups not configured
* mounted cd-roms
* unused and orphaned discs
* more, more, more

== Implementation

We started in 2019 with command line development https://github.com/Corsinvest/cv4pve-diag[Github] and then implemented the web portal.

== General

Is possible to configure the link:#chapter_other_cron[Cron] scheduling to execute diagnostic, and send result on Pdf to mail.
