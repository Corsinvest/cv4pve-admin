When you have to specify what VM/CT insert inside a job you have these methods:

* comma separated (__100,101,102,TestDebian,VMName__)
* range (__100:107__)
* poolname (__@pool-test__)
* tagname (__@tag-test__)
* nodename (__@node-nodename__)
* every object of your host (__@all-nodename__)
* every object of your cluster (__@all__)

If you have to exclude some VMs or Containers just put the "-" sign in front of the ID/Name:

* -vmid or -name (__-200,-TestUbuntu__)

Mixed example:
----
100,101,102,-103,104,vmtest,-containertest
----
