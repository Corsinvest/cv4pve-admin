= Autosnap

== Need
Take a snapshot of a VM/CT at a fixed interval with a retention.

== Implementation

We started in 2016 with command line development https://github.com/Corsinvest/cv4pve-autosnap[Github] and then implemented the web portal.

== Note
WARNING: Do not schedule less than 15 minutes, there may be performance problems.

WARNING: If you include memory, the space and time will increase considerably. Test it before deploying to production environment.

NOTE: Pay attention to the timeout time.

NOTE: The location of the autosnap storage space is the same where the VM disk is located. This reduces the total storage capacity.
